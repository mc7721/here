Often referred as the \u201cTravelling Salesman Problem\u201d, the service takes into account the HERE road network restrictions as well as traffic pattern data to provide accurate travel times and distances between subsequent waypoints. Mode of travel, by car or truck, as well as route preference like fastest or shortest, can also be considered when applying for specific use cases.\n\n\nThis example set works with version **2.0** or higher\n\nAdditional information can be found on [developer.here.com](https:\/\/developer.here.com\/platform-extensions\/documentation\/routing-waypoints)",
